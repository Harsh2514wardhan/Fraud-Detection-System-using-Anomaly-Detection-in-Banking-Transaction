Fraud Detection System using Anomaly Detection in Banking Transactions
This project implements a Fraud Detection System utilizing Anomaly Detection techniques to identify suspicious or fraudulent banking transactions. The system analyzes transaction data and flags transactions that deviate significantly from normal behavior, helping to detect potential fraud in real-time.

Features
Anomaly Detection: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to detect outliers and anomalies in banking transaction data.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and converts categorical variables to numerical representations.
Real-time Detection: Detects fraudulent transactions in real-time based on predefined thresholds and behavioral patterns.
Visualization: Provides visual representation of transaction data and detected anomalies using charts and graphs.
Model Evaluation: Includes performance evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess the effectiveness of the model.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and visualization.
Installation
To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd fraud-detection-system
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to start using the fraud detection system.

Usage
Load transaction data into the system (CSV, database, or API).
The system will analyze the data and flag any transaction that appears anomalous.
Review the flagged transactions to confirm potential fraud.
